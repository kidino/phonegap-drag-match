Simple Example for Phonegap Drag-n-Match App
============================================

You can build an app for your kids too. A simple Drag-and-Match app built with Phonegap, jQuery, jQueryUI and Touch Punch.

Please note that this is still a work in progress. It's not an official release, be it beta, alpha or whatever. Plus I suck and versioning and very new to Git and Github.

However, my objective is this -- I want to be able to share with you a simple app that you can modify and make your own. This app is built with Phonegap. I mostly develop this targeting tablet Android devices but I will do my best to make it compatible cross-platform. Also, my plan is to have this repo to be ready for Phonegap Build (which it is not yet). When we have that, you can simply fork this and add it to your Phonegap Build account and start compiling.

At the moment, I don't have much documentation for this. But most codes are commentend and you can take a look at that. Generally, I try to separate the data for the app from the working codes. The data is a set of JSON array that contains your draggable items and its target items. For example, the letter A can only be dragged to the image of an Apple.

Before I forget, I use images from members at DeviantArt.com. I include links to them in the JSON data file. Please respect these people and leave the credits intact if you are using the same images.

Alright, that's all for now.
